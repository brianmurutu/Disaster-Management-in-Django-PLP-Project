3. **Contribute Code:** 
   * Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
   * Make your changes, following our code style guidelines (if any).
   * Write tests for your changes to ensure they don't break existing functionality.
   * Open a pull request, clearly describing your changes and the problem they solve.

## Code Style Guidelines

We adhere to the following code style guidelines to maintain consistency and readability throughout the project:

*   **PEP 8:** We follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code. This includes:
    *   **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces for each indentation level.
    *   **Line Length:** Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
    *   **Blank Lines:** Surround top-level functions and classes with two blank lines.
    *   **Naming Conventions:** Use lowercase with underscores for variables and functions (e.g., `incident_type`), and CamelCase for classes (e.g., `IncidentManager`).

*   **Django Coding Style:** We follow Django's recommended coding conventions, which you can find in the Django documentation.

*   **Comments:** Write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of your code. Use docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.

*   **Type Hints:** Use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability (optional, but recommended).

**Additional Tips:**

*   **Code Reviews:** All pull requests will be reviewed by other contributors to ensure they meet our coding standards.
